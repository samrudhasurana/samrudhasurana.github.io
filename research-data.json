      "abstract": "Reliable and affordable electricity supply is crucial for achieving IndiaÃ¢ÂÂs manufacturing goals. However, manufacturers face interruptions in power supply because state-owned distribution companies are financially distressed. Furthermore, political incentives have led state governments to charge manufacturers higher tariffs than farmers and households to subsidize the latter groups. High tariffs and unreliable electricity incentivize manufacturers to shift to alternative sources such as open access and captive generation. However, states have resisted this shift by imposing regulatory barriers and various charges to protect the revenues of the distribution companies. This paper examines the resulting challenges for manufacturers. It recommends removing crosssubsidies and transitioning to direct-benefit transfers, easing regulations on alternative power sources, and reorganizing the electricity sector to improve supply reliability and support industrial growth."

      "title": "A Dissenting Voice: B.R. Shenoy's Austrian Economic Critique of India's Central Planning",
      "authors": "with Vinayakan Sajeev-Beena",
      "url": "https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=5117877",
      "abstract": "B. R. Shenoy stood as the sole Indian dissenter against central planning in the early decades of India's independence. Although it has been noted that Shenoy's critique of planning was influenced by F. A. Hayek after he attended his lectures as a graduate student at the London School of Economics, the influence of the Austrian school of economics on Shenoy's arguments has not been fully explored. We trace the roots of Shenoy's arguments within the Austrian framework, particularly in the context of the Socialist Calculation Debate and the Hayek-Keynes debate on government fiscal and monetary interventions. This paper highlights how Shenoy's prescient critiques of inflation, resource misallocation, and the knowledge problem in India's planning efforts were grounded in the theories and frameworks of the Austrian school of economics.",
