      "abstract": "B.R. Shenoy was one of India's most prominent economists and a lone dissenting voice against Nehruvian central planning in the 1950s and 1960s. This paper examines Shenoy's Austrian economic critique of India's planned economy, analyzing his theoretical contributions and policy recommendations. We explore how his insights align with modern Austrian economics and assess the relevance of his warnings for contemporary development policy."
